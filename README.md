**BTTM - codename: Flavona**

**BTTM: Brake & Tire Temperature Monitor**
A motorsport telemetry system for real-time thermal monitoring of racing vehicle performance. BTTM integrates distributed infrared and RTD temperature sensors across tire and brake systems, reporting via CAN bus to a central ESP32-S3 hub with WiFi telemetry, local web interface, and on-board data logging.
Features

Multi-node CAN architecture with dedicated brake and tire sensor nodes
Infrared temperature detection
Central monitoring unit with ESP32-S3 microcontroller
Real-time web telemetry dashboard over WiFi
Local TFT display for trackside feedback
High-frequency data logging and cloud backup integration
Mesh networking support for extended track coverage

**Hardware**

- ESP32-S3 main hub (ver 1.2)
- ESP32-C3 CAN node IR Sensors (ver 1.1)

All PCB designs are custom.
